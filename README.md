## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Filter job listings based on the categories

### Links

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Redux](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) - React State Management Tool

### What I learned

I've taken a bigger project but I couldn't implement the data flow and state management because I didn't know how to use Redux. This project took more time than initially, I've thought.
